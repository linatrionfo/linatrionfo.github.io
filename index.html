        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In a bowl, combine chicken with all of the ingredients for the chicken marinade; let marinate for a minimum of 30 minutes. <br>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Heat oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. When sizzling, add chicken pieces in batches of two or three, making sure not to crowd the pan. Fry until browned for only 3 minutes on each side. Set aside and keep warm. <br>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> Heat butter in the same pan. Fry the onions until they start to carmelize while scraping up any browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pan. <br>
        <strong>Step 4:</strong> Add garlic and ginger and sauté for 1 minute until fragrant, then add ground coriander, cumin and garam masala. Let cook for about 20 seconds until fragrant, while stirring occasionally.<br>
        <strong>Step 5:</strong> Add crushed tomatoes, chili powder and salt. Let simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until sauce thickens and becomes a deep brown red colour.<br>
        <strong>Step 6:</strong>Remove from heat, scoop mixture into a blender and blend until smooth. You may need to add a couple tablespoons of water to help it blend (up to 1/4 cup). Work in batches depending on the size of your blender.
 <br>
        <strong>Step 7:</strong> Pour the puréed sauce back into the pan. Stir the cream and sugar through the sauce. Add the chicken with juices back into the pan and cook for an additional 8-10 minutes until chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thick and bubbling.<br>
        <strong>Step 8:</strong> Serve warm with Jasmine Rice and Naan!

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Combine 1 cup (125g) of flour, instant yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. If desired, add garlic powder and dried basil at this point as well. <br>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Add olive oil and warm water and use a wooden spoon to stir well very well. <br>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> Gradually add another 1 cup (125g) of flour. Add any additional flour as needed (I've found that sometimes I need as much as an additional ⅓ cup), stirring until the dough is forming into a cohesive, elastic ball and is beginning to pull away from the sides of the bowl (see video above recipe for visual cue). The dough will still be slightly sticky but still should be manageable with your hands.  <br>
        <strong>Step 4:</strong> Drizzle a separate, large, clean bowl generously with olive oil and use a pastry brush to brush up the sides of the bowl.  <br>
        <strong>Step 5:</strong> Lightly dust your hands with flour and form your pizza dough into a round ball and transfer to your olive oil-brushed bowl. Use your hands to roll the pizza dough along the inside of the bowl until it is coated in olive oil, then cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and place it in a warm place..  <br>
        <strong>Step 6:</strong> Allow dough to rise for 30 minutes or until doubled in size. If you intend to bake this dough into a pizza, I also recommend preheating your oven to 425F (215C) at this point so that it will have reached temperature once your pizza is ready to bake.  <br>
        <strong>Step 7:</strong> Once the dough has risen, use your hands to gently deflate it and transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead briefly until smooth (about 3-5 times).   <br>
        <strong>Step 8:</strong> Use either your hands or a rolling pin to work the dough into 12" circle.  <br>
        <strong>Step 9:</strong> Transfer dough to a parchment paper lined pizza pan and either pinch the edges or fold them over to form a crust.  <br>
        <strong>Step 10:</strong> Drizzle additional olive oil (about a Tablespoon) over the top of the pizza and use your pastry brush to brush the entire surface of the pizza (including the crust) with olive oil.   <br>
        <strong>Step 11:</strong> Use a fork to poke holes all over the center of the pizza to keep the dough from bubbling up in the oven.  <br>
        <strong>Step 12:</strong> Spread Sauce and  sprinkle cheese over the top. Add any desired toppings such as meat or vegetables. 
  <br>
        <strong>Step 13:</strong> Bake in a 425F (215C) preheated oven for 13-15 minutes or until toppings are golden brown.  <br>
        <strong>Step 14:</strong> Slice and Serve.  <br>
